# Rimar - Career Foundry - Achievement 6

# Project Overview
This repository is a collection of deliverables and reports created for Achievement 6 of the Career Foundry Data Analytics program. For this project, I chose my own data set (Citi Bike trip records for September 2013) and used advanced analytics to explore the data and find connections between different variables.

# Objectives and Analysis Criteria
Objective: To build an interactive dashboard that will visually showcase well-curated results of an advanced exploratory analysis conducted in Python.

Analysis Criteria:
- Exploratory analysis through visualizations
- Geospatial analysis using a shapefile
- Regression analysis
- Cluster analysis
- Time-series analysis
- Analysis narrative and final results
